## Description of Project


Here I implemented a basic Snake Game inspired by the classic arcade game Snake.

1.The snake is represented as 0.

2.The fruit is represented with an *(asterisk) symbol by eating it you get score and your score will be Increase with each fruit.

3.The snake can be move in any four direction according your given command i.e

A=left
W=Up
S=Down
D=Right

4.Increment in Score will be 10 after snake will eat a fruit.

5.The fruit will generate automatically within the boundaries.

6.And whenever snake will touch the boundary line game will over and you get your final score.

## High Level Requirements
There will be four user-defined functions.
Build a boundary within which the game will be played.
The fruits are generated randomly.
Then increase the score whenever the snake eats a fruit.

The user-defined functions created in this program are-
Draw(),boundary(),Input(),Logic().
## Low level Requirements

rand(): This rand() function is use to return a random value whenever its called.

Draw(): This function is responsible to build the boundary within which the game will be played.

boundary(): This function is use to write the code to generate the fruit within the boundary using rand() function.

Input(): In this function, the programmer writes the code to take the input from the keyboard (W, A, S, D, X keys).

logic(): Here, write all the logic for this program like for the movement of the snake, for increasing the score, when the snake will touch the boundary the game will be over, to exit the game and the random generation of the fruit once the snake will eat the fruit.

sleep(): This function in C is a function that delays the program execution for the given number of seconds. In this code sleep() is used to slow down the movement of the snake so it will be easy for the user to play.

main(): From the main() function the execution of the program starts. It calls all the functions.
## Features
