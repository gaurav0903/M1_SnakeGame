
Here I implemented a basic Snake Game inspired by the classic arcade game Snake.

1.The snake is represented as 0.

2.The fruit is represented with an *(asterisk) symbol by eating it you get score and your score will be Increase with each fruit.

3.The snake can be move in any four direction according your given command i.e

A=left
W=Up
S=Down
D=Right

4.Increment in Score will be 10 after snake will eat a fruit.

5.The fruit will generate automatically within the boundaries.

6.And whenever snake will touch the boundary line game will over and you get your final score.
